## Setup/Installation Requirements
Download .NET Core 2.1.3 SDK and .NET Core Runtime 2.0.9 and install them.
## Specs:

1. The user is able to add a single stylist to the database at a time.
2. The user can enter details about a stylist, particularly their specialities. There is no limit to the number of specialties that can be listed under a stylist.
3. The user is then able to add one client at a time to that stylist. Each client only belongs to one stylist.
